        SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's
    </h3>
    <p class="stage">Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF</p>
    <h6 class="name PRINCE">PRINCE HENRY</h6>
    <p class="speech">
        Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack<br>
        and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping<br> upon
        benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to<br>
        demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.<br>
        What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the<br>
        day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes<br>
        capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the<br>
        signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself<br>
        a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no<br>
        reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand<br>
        the time of the day.</P>
    <h6 class="name FALSTAFF">FALSTAFF</h6>
    <p class="speech">
        Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take<br>
        purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not<br>
        by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,<br>
        I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God<br>
        save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace<br>
        thou wilt have none,--</P>
    <h6 class="name PRINCE">PRINCE HENRY</h6>
    <p class="speech">
        What, none?</P><br>
    <h6 class="name FALSTAFF">FALSTAFF</h6>
    <p class="speech">
        No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to<br>
        prologue to an egg and butter.</P><br>
    <h6 class="name PRINCE">PRINCE HENRY</h6>
    <p class="speech">
        Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.</P>
    <h6 class="name FALSTAFF">FALSTAFF</h6>
    <p class="speech">
        Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not<br>
        us that are squires of the night's body be <br>called
        thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's<br>
        foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the<br>
        moon; and let men say we be men of good government,<br>
        being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and<br>
        chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.</P><br>
    <h6 class="name PRINCE">PRINCE HENRY</h6>
    <p class="speech">
        Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the<br>
        fortune of us that are the moon's men doth <br>ebb and
        flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,<br>
        by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold<br>
        most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most<br>
        dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with<br>
        swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'<br>
        now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder<br>
        and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.</P>
    <h6 class="name FALSTAFF">FALSTAFF</h6>
    <p class="speech">
        By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my<br>
        hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?</P>
    <h6 class="name PRINCE">PRINCE HENRY</h6>
    <p class="speech">
        As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And<br>
        is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?</p>
